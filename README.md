# CTC19
This is the home repository for [CTC19: History + Data = Innovation](https://codethecity.org/what-we-do/hack-weekends/code-the-city-19-history-data-innovation/) which was our first online co-design and hack event. After the closure of  [ONE Codebase in Aberdeen](https://www.thisiscodebase.com/aberdeen1), due to Covid-19, we opted to explore how we might pursue this event online over the weekend of 11/12 April 2020.

We expect to have groups of people working on a variety of projects over the weekend. Much of the activity will be around two larger projects detailed below.

## Aberdeen Harbour Arrivals
This project is transcribing the harbour board records from 1914-1920 so that some data analysis can be done with them. A [historical harbour arrivals api](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/historical_harbour_arrivals_api) was put together to track progress in the week before the online event.

## Adding Aberdeen to the Wiki Data Commons
A number of people will be working on adding data to the Wiki Data as seen on the [Dashboard](https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/courses/CodeTheCity/CTC19-Data-History-Innovation/home)

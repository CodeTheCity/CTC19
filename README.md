# CTC19
This is the home repository for [CTC19: History + Data = Innovation](https://codethecity.org/what-we-do/hack-weekends/code-the-city-19-history-data-innovation/) which was our first online co-design and hack event. After the closure of  [ONE Codebase in Aberdeen](https://www.thisiscodebase.com/aberdeen1), due to Covid-19, we opted to explore how we might pursue this event online over the weekend of 11/12 April 2020. We had 9 regular participants on Saturday, and 8 on Sunday, who broke into three teams, as detailed below.

We used a [Zoom](http://zoom.us) session to hold the space and alternated between main room where everyone should be together, and breakout rooms for group work in 90 minutes blocks of time. We then came back together to check in on how teams were getting on, and to share information and offers of help.

We used [Slack](http://slack.com) and our Code the City workgroup as the back channel between rooms, and to coordinate the event outside of Zoom. This worked well in the run-up to the event, and also as the jumping off point for each day.

## Aberdeen Harbour Arrivals
This project is transcribing the harbour board records from 1914-1920 so that some data analysis can be done with them. A [historical harbour arrivals api](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/historical_harbour_arrivals_api) was put together to track progress in the week before the online event. The site was updated to include more graphs, more information about what is being shown too.

## Adding Aberdeen to the Wiki Data Commons
A number of people will be working on adding data to the Wiki Data as seen on the [Dashboard](https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/courses/CodeTheCity/CTC19-Data-History-Innovation/home), which focused on entering all of the Aberdeen provosts, and lord provosts, into Wiki Data. With 7 contributors we added 149,000 words, 187 new articles with 152 references, while editing 217 articles.

## Aberdeen Built Ships
As part of the wiki data effort, the [Aberdeen Built Ships](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/aberdeen-built-ships) scraps info from [Aberdeen Built Ships](http://www.aberdeenships.com/browse.asp) database to add data to the wiki data commons.
